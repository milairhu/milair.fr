# My personnal portfolio

This project is a simple portfolio to present my personnal projects and my profile. My objective is to discover how to buy and use a domain name, and how to host a website on it. It is incidentally an opportunity to discover how to use GitHub Pages and eventually to use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the website.

The website is available at the URL: [https://www.milair.io](https://www.milair.fr)
