This project is a simple portfolio to present my personnal projects and my resume. My objective is to discover how to buy, manage and use a domain name. It is additionnaly an opportunity to discover GitHub Pages and CI/CD pipelines to deploy automatically new versions of the website.

The website is a static project built with React and Tailwind CSS.
